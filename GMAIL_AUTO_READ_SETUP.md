# Gmail Integration Removed

The Gmail auto-read integration has been removed from this repository.

If you previously followed steps to set up Gmail polling, those files
and instructions were intentionally removed to simplify the project and
restore the SendGrid webhook-based flow.

If you need Gmail auto-reading again in the future, restore the
integration from version control or ask me to reintroduce a clean,
optional module for it.
